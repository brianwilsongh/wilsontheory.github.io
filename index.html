  <p>
    I'm a results-oriented backend software development engineer. My main programming languages are Java and Python. I have a 4 year old daughter and recently moved to the midwest. I'm interested in topics like big data processing frameworks, socket programming, and multithreading. It seems like this list grows every passing week.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have experience working with cloud technologies (AWS, Google Cloud), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), source control software (Github, Bitbucket), automation frameworks (Selenium, HTMLUnit), package managers (maven, npm, pip), web frameworks (Java EE, Spring, Node.js, React.js, Rails) and some other things including mobile development on Android. My most popular mobile app was used in over 50 countries, and I'm excited to make another in the near future.
