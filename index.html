  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I'm a language-agnostic software development engineer focused on producing code that is not only maintainable, but performant and highly scalable. I primarily work in the web and mobile (just Android, for now) space, and I mostly Java or Python if I need scripting. I'm interested in niche topics like big data, socket programming, functional programming, and multithreading and it seems like this list is growing every day.</p>
